## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Lais Gabrielle Lodi

#### ...but you can call my Gabby!

I am a Full Stack Developer with 5+ years of experience building large-scale web applications. Proficient in ReactJS, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Also knowledgeble in Java, Python, Relational databases, Docker, Jenkins, Linux environments and AWS.
I am a strong advocate for best practices. I am highly collaborative and data-driven, passionate about delivering high-quality, user-centred solutions in dynamic environments.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Frontend Opportunities whose goal is to include people with vision disabilities to deepen my knowledge on WCAG and promote better interaction with all people, removing any common, but frequent, obstacles on websites that prevent some people to access information.  

âš¡ Fun fact:
I collect plushes! I have tons of bears and dogs, whales, a mamute, a wolf, the whole Gang of Winnie The Pooh and a few more.
I also love to learn new things and my favourite thing to learn is a new language! I speak English, Portuguese, Spanish, a few Italian phrases and my next to-learn language is French. And I still want to learn ASL. My dream is to be able to speak to any person in the world, so I am always trying to learn at least a few words in every language I can.
